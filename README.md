# LiteAttention

LiteAttention is a lightweight Flash Attention 3 wrapper with skip list optimization.

## Requirements
- H100 / H800 GPU
- CUDA >= 12.8
- CUDA toolkit
- PyTorch 2.2 and above
- `packaging` Python package (`pip install packaging`)
- `ninja` Python package (`pip install ninja`) *
- Linux

\* Make sure that `ninja` is installed and that it works correctly (e.g. `ninja
--version` then `echo $?` should return exit code 0). If not (sometimes `ninja
--version` then `echo $?` returns a nonzero exit code), uninstall then reinstall
`ninja` (`pip uninstall -y ninja && pip install ninja`). Without `ninja`,
compiling can take a very long time (2h) since it does not use multiple CPU
cores. With `ninja` compiling takes 3-5 minutes on a 64-core machine using CUDA toolkit.

## Installation

```sh
cd hopper
python setup.py install
```

If your machine has less than 96GB of RAM and lots of CPU cores, `ninja` might
run too many parallel compilation jobs that could exhaust the amount of RAM. To
limit the number of parallel compilation jobs, you can set the environment
variable `MAX_JOBS`:
```sh
MAX_JOBS=4 pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## How to use LiteAttention

The main functions implement scaled dot product attention (softmax(Q @ K^T *
softmax_scale) @ V):
```python
from lite_attention import LiteAttention, 


flash_attn_func(q, k, v, dropout_p=0.0, softmax_scale=None, causal=False,
                window_size=(-1, -1), alibi_slopes=None, deterministic=False):
"""dropout_p should be set to 0.0 during evaluation
Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in KV with fewer heads
than Q. Note that the number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.
For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, head 0, 1, 2 of Q will attention to head
0 of K, V, and head 3, 4, 5 of Q will attention to head 1 of K, V.
If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i
will only attend to keys between
[i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - window_size[0], i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q + window_size[1]] inclusive.

Arguments:
    q: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim)
    k: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads_k, headdim)
    v: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads_k, headdim)
    dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
    softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
        Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
    causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
    window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
    alibi_slopes: (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of
        (-alibi_slope * |i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - j|)
        is added to the attention score of query i and key j.
    deterministic: bool. Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass,
        which is slightly slower and uses more memory. The forward pass is always deterministic.
Return:
    out: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim).
